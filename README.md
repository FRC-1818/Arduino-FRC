# Arduino-FRC
Arduino code that is useful for subsystems of a FRC robot for testing purposes

First we will implement servo with a FRC like interface

we want to make this functionality from frc https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/blob/master/wpilibc/athena/src/Servo.cpp
in to our own servo.cpp

The Arduino library code is here https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/Servo/src
The documentation is here https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo

The servo.cpp file will need to take the functions defined for FRC and translate the numbers to what the Arduino library it expects.

I hope that everyone make a effort to work on this, it is a group project start with small steps.

    1. make a git commit with your name to the contributor.md file
    
    2. make changes to servo.cpp start adding code that defines functions if you need to add comments that explain what you think needs to be include that you don't know how to do
